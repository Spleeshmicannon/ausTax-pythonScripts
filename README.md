# Python Scripts for doing my Tax
Currently there is just cgcalc.py in here, but I suspect I'll probably add more
at some point. 

## cgcalc.py
This is written to work specifically with the tax excel files (once exported to csv) that
you get from stake (hellostake.com.au, not the gambling platform). It does not currently
apply the capital gains discount since I'm just using it to help double check manual 
calculations.
